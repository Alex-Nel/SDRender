# SDRender
### A functional software renderer built using SDL.

The 'structures.h' and 'render.h' headers can be used as a library (SDL is needed for the render.h to function)

- "render.h" defines the render functions, which are SDL dependent. <br>
- "structures.h" defines all the 3D and 2D structs which can be used for anything.
